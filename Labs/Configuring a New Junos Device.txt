In this lab, I utilized a few of the commands that would be helpful when setting up a new Junos device, such as configuring a new user, manually setting a 
time (Using an NTP server would be better), configuring login messages and announcements, and creating a rescue configuration.

cli

show interfaces terse fxp0
show configration interfaces fxp0

show configuration system login user Lab

configure
set system login user s.parker class read-only
set system login user s.parker authentication plain-text-password
lab123
lab123

show | compare
commit and-quit
show configuration system login user s.parker

ssh s.parker@172.25.11.1
lab123

These commands won't work because I'm logged in as a read-only user:
show configuration
configure
request system reboot
ping 172.16.10.27

This command will work:
show system information
exit

Logged in as a different user:
show system uptime
configure
set system time-zone America/New_York
show | compare
commit and-quit
set date 201007010900
show system uptime
set date 202503130242

configure
set system login message "Welcome to this rputer! Please enter the correct login details below:"
set system login announcement "You have successfully loggin in!\nPlease don't type any illegal commands.\n"
