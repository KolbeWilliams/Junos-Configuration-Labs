In this lab, I delete static routes and configure the interfaces on a router to use OSPF as well as OSPF3

cli
configure
delete routing-options static route 172.16.40.0/24
delete routing-options rib inet6.0 static route 2001:db8:0:40::/64

show ospf neighbor
show route protocol ospf

show interfaces descriptions

set protocols ospf area 0 interfaces ge-0/0/1.0 passive
set protocols ospf area 0 interfaces ge-0/0/2.0 passive

On Second Router:

show route 172.16.10.1
show route protocol ospf

Back on First Router for OSPF3

configure
set protocols ospf3 area 0 interface ge-0/0/5.0
set protocols ospf3 area 0 interface ge-0/0/1.0 passive
set protocols ospf3 area 0 interface ge-0/0/2.0 passive
