In this lab, I configure different firewall filter tearms on ROUTER_1 and test the filters using ROUTER_2.

cli
configure

edit firewall family inet filter FILTER_FROM_ROUTER_2

set term BLOCK_PING_FROM_40-1 from source-address 172.16.40.1
set term BLOCK_PING_FROM_40-1 from icmp-type echo-request
set term BLOCK_PING_FROM_40-1 from icmp-type echo-reply
set term BLOCK_PING_FROM_40-1 then discard

top
set interfaces ge-0/0/5 unit 0 family inet filter input FILTER_FROM_ROUTER_2
show | compare

SSH to ROUTER_2 to test filter:
ssh lab@172.25.11.2
ping 172.16.10.1 source 172.16.40.1 count 3
ping 172.16.10.1 count 2

Back to ROUTER_1:
edit firewall family inet filter FILTER_FROM_ROUTER_2
set term ACCEPT_ALL_FROM_ROUTER_2 from source-address 172.16.40.0/24
set term ACCEPT_ALL_FROM_ROUTER_2 from source-address 10.1.2.0/24
set term ACCEPT_ALL_FROM_ROUTER_2 then accept

Back on ROUTER_2:
ping 172.16.0.1 count 2

Back on ROUTER_1:
show ospf neighbor
configure
edit firewall family inet filter FILTER_FROM_ROUTER_2
set term BLOCK_R1-R2_INTERFACE from source-address 10.1.2.2/32
set term BLOCK_R1-R2_INTERFACE then discard

Back on ROUTER_2:
ssh lab@10.1.2.1
ping 10.1.2.1 source 10.1.2.2 count 2
show ospf neighbor

Back on ROUTER_1:
set term ACCEPT_ALL_FROM_ROUTER_2 then count COUNT_FINAL_TERM

commit and-quit
show firewall counter COUNT_FINAL_TERM filter FILTER_FROM_ROUTER_2

Back on ROUTER_2:
ping 10.1.2.1 source 10.1.2.2 count 999 rapid size 1472

Back on ROUTER_1:
show firewall counter COUNT_FINAL_TERM filter FILTER_FROM_ROUTER_2

Delete the filters for ease of use in other labs:
configure
show interfaces ge-0/0/5 | display set
delete interaces ge-0/0/5 unit 0 family inet filter input
delete firewall
